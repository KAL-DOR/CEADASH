## üöÄ How to Apply Demo Data

### **Option 1: Supabase CLI (Recommended)**

1. **Make sure you're connected to your project:**
   ```bash
   cd ceadash
   supabase status
   ```

2. **Apply the migration:**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   This will apply the seed data migration along with any pending migrations.

### **Option 2: Supabase Dashboard**

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20241003000000_seed_demo_data.sql`
5. Click **Run**

### **Option 3: Direct SQL Execution**

```bash
cd ceadash
psql "YOUR_SUPABASE_CONNECTION_STRING" -f supabase/migrations/20241003000000_seed_demo_data.sql
```

---

## üîë Demo User Setup

### **Important: User Authentication**

The seed data creates a **placeholder user profile** with these credentials:
- **User ID:** `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002`
- **Email:** `demo@ceadash.com`
- **Name:** Usuario Demo
- **Organization:** Demo Organization

‚ö†Ô∏è **However**, Supabase authentication requires a real user account. You have two options:

### **Option A: Use Demo Mode (Easiest)**
1. Click the **"Continuar como Demo"** button on the login page
2. This bypasses authentication and shows you the demo data immediately
3. Perfect for presentations and quick testing

### **Option B: Create a Real Demo Account**
1. Sign up at `/` with email `demo@ceadash.com` (or any email you prefer)
2. After signup, update the seed data to match your real user ID:
   ```sql
   -- Get your actual user ID from auth.users
   SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
   
   -- Update the demo profile with your real ID
   UPDATE profiles 
   SET id = 'YOUR-ACTUAL-UUID-HERE'
   WHERE email = 'demo@ceadash.com';
   
   -- Update all demo data to be owned by your user
   UPDATE contacts SET created_by = 'YOUR-ACTUAL-UUID-HERE' WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
   UPDATE processes SET created_by = 'YOUR-ACTUAL-UUID-HERE' WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
   UPDATE scheduled_calls SET created_by = 'YOUR-ACTUAL-UUID-HERE' WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
   UPDATE activities SET user_id = 'YOUR-ACTUAL-UUID-HERE' WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
   ```

## üìä Expected Dashboard Stats After Seeding

Once the demo data is loaded, your dashboard should show:

### **Statistics:**
- **Total Processes:** 7 (4 active, 1 draft, 2 archived)
- **Scheduled Calls:** 2 (upcoming calls)
- **Active Contacts:** 5
- **Average Efficiency:** ~82.7%

### **Recent Activity Feed:**
- 8 activity entries showing the last 5 days
- Mix of process creations, contacts, and completed calls
- Real-time updates when new events occur

### **Charts:**
- Process efficiency chart with 4 active processes
- Efficiency scores ranging from 72% to 91%

---

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### **1. Test Real-time Activity Feed**
- Open the dashboard in one browser tab
- Open another tab and create a new contact
- Watch the activity feed update automatically in the first tab ‚ú®

### **2. Test Call Scheduling**
- Go to **Programaci√≥n** page
- Schedule a new call with any contact
- See it appear in the scheduled calls list
- Check the activity feed for the "call scheduled" entry

### **3. Test Webhook Simulation**
You can simulate webhook events by directly calling the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/webhook/elevenlabs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "event": "call_started",
    "call_id": "test-call-123",
    "data": {}
  }'
```

### **4. Test Process Management**
- Create a new process
- Watch it appear immediately
- Check the stats update in real-time
- Archive it and see stats update again

### **5. Test Multi-tenancy (Advanced)**
- Sign up with a different email to create a new organization
- Verify you can't see the demo organization's data
- All queries should be isolated by organization_id

---

## üóëÔ∏è Clean Up Demo Data

If you want to remove all demo data and start fresh:

```sql
-- Delete all data for the demo organization
DELETE FROM activities WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM transcriptions WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM scheduled_calls WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM processes WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM contacts WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM profiles WHERE organization_id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
DELETE FROM organizations WHERE id = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001';
```

## üé® Customizing Demo Data

You can modify the seed file to add your own data:

1. Edit `supabase/migrations/20241003000000_seed_demo_data.sql`
2. Add more contacts, processes, or calls
3. Rerun the migration:
   ```bash
   supabase db reset  # Warning: This resets ALL data
   ```
   Or manually run the INSERT statements in SQL Editor

## üì∏ Demo Screenshots Checklist

Perfect for presentations! Make sure to show:

- ‚úÖ Dashboard with populated stats
- ‚úÖ Real-time activity feed with recent entries
- ‚úÖ Contacts page with 6 contacts
- ‚úÖ Scheduling page with upcoming and completed calls
- ‚úÖ Processes page with different statuses
- ‚úÖ Process efficiency chart
- ‚úÖ Activity feed auto-updating (live demo!)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Problem: No data appears after running migration**
**Solution:** Check that the migration ran successfully:
```bash
supabase migration list
# Should show 20241003000000_seed_demo_data applied
```

### **Problem: RLS policies block access**
**Solution:** Make sure you're logged in as a user that belongs to the demo organization, or use demo mode.

### **Problem: Activity feed is empty**
**Solution:** The real-time subscription requires the user's organization_id. Make sure you're authenticated properly.

### **Problem: Can't see demo data in demo mode**
**Solution:** Check that your middleware is properly setting the demo organization ID in the demo mode path.
